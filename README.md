# <ins>How do you make a Circle in CSS?</ins>
First you make a section with an equal width and height property. It would also be best to add a background color or border so it is visible. Next you would give it a border radius of 50% to round the corners of the square into a circle.
# <ins>What is Z-index?</ins>
Z-index allows you to assign the order in which things appear on the page 3 dimensionally. For example in the case of over-lapping objects, you would assign a higher index to the object that you want to appear to be on top.
# <ins>What is a Vendor Prefix and What is it's Purpose?</ins>
CSS Vendor prefixes (or browser prefixes) are a way for browsers to give access to new CSS features not yet considered stable. By using prefixes, we can use these newer CSS features with the browsers that support them — instead of waiting for all browsers to catch up.
# <ins>What is the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox?</ins>
Css Grid allows you to customize a grid that will best fit the desired layout of your webpage. CSS Flexbox uses design principles based on the relativity of all of the “boxes” on your page to larger parent boxes.

# <ins>What is CRUD?
In computer programming, create, read, update, and delete are the four basic operations of persistent storage. CRUD is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information using computer-based forms and reports.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
